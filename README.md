### LearnFusion360in30Days

* I'm following a tutorial on youtube (Learn Autodesk Fusion 360 in 30 Days for Complete Beginners! 2023-23 EDITION by Kevin Kennedy). Although I'm well over the 30 days I have something to show for my time. Hopefully after I'm done with the all the tutorials in the playlist I will have gained the introductory skills to make my own models for 3d printing!

  Here's the link to the playlist if you're interested. [Learn Autodesk Fusion 360 in 30 Days](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrZ2zKOtC_-C4rWfapgngoe9o2-ng8ZBr)
